# Fraud Detection System: Component Relationships and Workflow

## Component Overview and Roles

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all transaction requests; routes requests to internal services.
- **Data Aggregation Service**: Collects and enriches transaction data from various sources (user profile, payment history, geo-location, etc.).
- **Scoring Service**: Evaluates transactions using rules and machine learning models to assign a fraud risk score.
- **Machine Learning Model (Training Pipeline)**: Continuously trains and updates the fraud detection model using historical data.
- **Message Queue**: Buffers and distributes events (e.g., flagged transactions) to downstream consumers (logging, notifications, etc.).
- **Database**: Stores transaction data, user profiles, fraud logs, and model outputs.
- **Fraud Analyst Admin Tool**: Interface for fraud analysts to review, investigate, and resolve flagged transactions.
- **User Profile Service**: Provides user information for risk assessment.
- **Payment History Service**: Supplies past payment data for behavioral analysis.
- **Geo-location Service**: Determines the location of the transaction.
- **Device Fingerprinting Service**: Identifies the device used for the transaction.
- **IP Reputation Service**: Assesses the risk associated with the transaction's IP address.
- **User-Agent Service**: Analyzes the browser or app used for the transaction.
- **Email Verification Service**: Validates the user's email address.
- **Phone Number Verification Service**: Validates the user's phone number.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Transaction Submission**: User initiates a transaction via the API Gateway.
2. **Data Aggregation**: The Data Aggregation Service collects and enriches transaction data from various internal and external services (user profile, payment history, geo-location, etc.).
3. **Scoring**: The Scoring Service evaluates the transaction using business rules and the latest machine learning model, assigning a fraud risk score.
4. **Decision**:
   - If the transaction is low risk, it is approved.
   - If flagged as potentially fraudulent:
     - The transaction is rejected.
     - The event is logged in the Database.
     - The event is sent to the Message Queue for further processing.
5. **Notification**: The Message Queue triggers notifications to the Operations Team and makes the event available for review in the Fraud Analyst Admin Tool.
6. **Review and Resolution**:
   - Fraud analysts use the Admin Tool to investigate flagged transactions.
   - If a transaction is found to be legitimate, it can be unblocked (within a few hours as per requirements).
7. **Model Improvement**: Data engineers and data scientists use historical data to retrain and improve the machine learning model, which is then redeployed to the Scoring Service.

## Notes
- The system is designed for high scalability, availability, durability, and extensibility.
- All components interact via secure, reliable APIs and messaging systems.
