# Typeahead System Design

## Overview
The typeahead system is designed to provide real-time suggestions to users as they type, returning the top 10 terms that match the current input prefix. The system must be highly performant, with suggestions appearing within 200ms.

## Architecture
- **Client:** Sends user input (prefix) to the backend and displays suggestions.
- **Backend Service:** Receives prefix queries, searches the in-memory index, and returns the top 10 matching terms.
- **In-Memory Index:** Stores all terms in a data structure optimized for prefix search (trie).

## Data Structure
- **Trie (Prefix Tree):**
  - Each node represents a character.
  - Paths from the root to a node represent prefixes.
  - Each node may store a list of top terms (by frequency or lexicographical order) for fast retrieval.
  - The trie is case-insensitive.

## Key Components
1. **Trie Construction:**
   - Build the trie from the initial dataset of terms.
   - Optionally, update the trie as new terms are added.
2. **Prefix Search:**
   - Traverse the trie according to the input prefix.
   - Collect up to 10 matching terms from the subtree.
3. **API Layer:**
   - Exposes an endpoint for prefix queries.
   - Returns suggestions in real-time.

## Performance Considerations
- All data is stored in memory for low-latency access.
- Trie nodes may cache top suggestions to speed up lookups.
- The system is designed to handle high query throughput.

## Scalability
- For very large datasets, the trie can be sharded or partitioned across multiple servers.
- Load balancing can be used to distribute queries.

## Fault Tolerance
- Periodic snapshots of the trie can be persisted to disk for recovery.
- Redundant instances can be deployed for high availability.

## Security
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks.
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Assumptions
- The dataset fits in memory.
- The system is case-insensitive.
- No external database is used for query-time lookups.
