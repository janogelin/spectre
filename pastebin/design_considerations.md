# Pastebin Design Considerations

## 0. Paste Size Limits
- **Rationale:** Limiting the maximum size of a paste prevents abuse (e.g., DoS attacks), protects system resources, and aligns with typical user expectations for a pastebin service.
- **Recommended Limit:** Set a default maximum paste size of **512 KB** (524,288 bytes) per paste. This value should be configurable via environment variable or settings.
- **Implementation:**
  - Enforce the limit in the API layer (e.g., FastAPI request validation).
  - Optionally, enforce at the reverse proxy/web server level (e.g., Nginx, Traefik).
  - Return a clear error message if a user attempts to exceed the limit.

## 1. Data Expiry and Storage
- **Efficient Expiry:** Use Redis for storing pastes with TTL for automatic expiration. For longer-term or permanent pastes, use PostgreSQL with scheduled cleanup jobs.
- **Consistency:** Ensure expired pastes are removed from both Redis and PostgreSQL to avoid stale data.
- **Backup & Durability:** Regularly back up PostgreSQL to prevent data loss and ensure high reliability.

## 2. Unique and Secure URLs
- **Token Generation:** Use cryptographically secure random generators (e.g., itsdangerous) to create unguessable URLs.
- **Custom Aliases:** Enforce uniqueness and validate custom aliases to prevent collisions and abuse.

## 3. High Availability & Reliability
- **Redundancy:** Deploy across multiple availability zones or regions to minimize downtime.
- **Failover:** Use managed database and cache services with automatic failover.
- **Health Checks:** Implement health checks and monitoring for all components.

## 4. Performance & Scalability
- **Caching:** Use Redis for frequently accessed or recent pastes to reduce database load and improve latency.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Design the API layer to be stateless for easy horizontal scaling behind a load balancer.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.

## 5. Security
- **Input Validation:** Use Pydantic and FastAPI validation to sanitize and validate all user input.
- **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for all endpoints to protect data in transit.
- **Abuse Prevention:** Monitor for spam and abuse; implement CAPTCHA or authentication for sensitive operations if needed.

## 6. Analytics
- **Access Counting:** Store and increment access counts efficiently, possibly using Redis counters for real-time analytics and syncing to PostgreSQL for persistence.
- **Privacy:** Ensure analytics do not leak sensitive information or violate user privacy.

## 7. API Design
- **RESTful Principles:** Design clear, versioned REST endpoints for all operations (create, retrieve, analytics, etc.).
- **Documentation:** Provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for easy integration by other services.

## 8. Extensibility & Maintainability
- **Modular Codebase:** Organize code into clear modules (API, storage, analytics, etc.) for easier maintenance and future feature additions.
- **Migrations:** Use Alembic for safe, versioned database schema changes.

## 9. Monitoring & Logging
- **Centralized Logging:** Use Loguru for structured, centralized logging.
- **Alerting:** Set up alerts for errors, downtime, or unusual activity.

**Summary:**
The design must balance speed (using Redis), durability (using PostgreSQL), security (unguessable URLs, input validation), and scalability (stateless API, horizontal scaling). It should also be easy to maintain and extend, with robust monitoring and analytics.
