# What Makes a Service Bad: An Extensive List

A "bad" service can manifest in many ways, from technical flaws to poor user experience and operational headaches. Below is a comprehensive list of characteristics, anti-patterns, and practices that contribute to a service being considered bad. Each point includes a brief explanation.

## 1. Poor Reliability
- **Frequent Downtime:** The service is often unavailable, causing user frustration and loss of trust.
- **Unpredictable Failures:** Failures occur without clear patterns, making troubleshooting difficult.
- **No Failover or Redundancy:** Single points of failure exist, and there are no backup systems.

## 2. Bad Performance
- **Slow Response Times:** The service takes too long to respond to requests.
- **Resource Inefficiency:** Consumes excessive CPU, memory, or bandwidth.
- **No Scalability:** Cannot handle increased load or traffic spikes.

## 3. Poor Security Practices
- **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** Anyone can access sensitive data or operations.
- **Insecure Data Storage:** Sensitive data is stored in plain text or with weak encryption.
- **No Input Validation:** Vulnerable to injection attacks and other exploits.

## 4. Bad API Design
- **Inconsistent Endpoints:** Naming conventions and structures are not uniform.
- **Leaky Abstractions:** Internal implementation details are exposed.
- **Lack of Versioning:** Breaking changes are introduced without warning.
- **Poor Documentation:** APIs are undocumented or have outdated/incomplete docs.

## 5. Lack of Observability
- **No Logging:** Failures and important events are not logged.
- **No Monitoring or Metrics:** No way to track health, performance, or usage.
- **No Alerting:** Issues go unnoticed until users complain.

## 6. Poor Error Handling
- **Silent Failures:** Errors are swallowed or ignored.
- **Unhelpful Error Messages:** Errors do not provide actionable information.
- **No Retry Logic:** Temporary failures are not retried, leading to unnecessary outages.

## 7. Bad Deployment and Operations
- **Manual Deployments:** Deployments require manual steps, increasing risk of human error.
- **No Rollback Mechanism:** Cannot revert to a previous stable version easily.
- **Lack of Automation:** Repetitive tasks are not automated.

## 8. Technical Debt and Code Quality
- **Spaghetti Code:** Codebase is tangled and hard to understand.
- **No Tests:** Lack of unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.
- **Outdated Dependencies:** Uses unsupported or vulnerable libraries.

## 9. Poor User Experience
- **Unintuitive Interfaces:** Users struggle to understand or use the service.
- **Lack of Accessibility:** Not usable by people with disabilities.
- **No Feedback Mechanisms:** Users cannot report issues or provide feedback.

## 10. Bad Communication and Collaboration
- **No Clear Ownership:** No one is responsible for the service.
- **Poor Documentation:** Lack of runbooks, onboarding guides, or architectural diagrams.
- **Siloed Knowledge:** Critical information is not shared among team members.

## 11. Ignoring Best Practices
- **No Backups:** Data loss is likely in case of failure.
- **No Disaster Recovery Plan:** No plan for major outages or data loss.
- **Ignoring Compliance:** Fails to meet legal or regulatory requirements.

## 12. Poor Change Management
- **No Change Tracking:** Changes are not tracked or reviewed.
- **No Staging Environment:** All changes go directly to production.
- **No Communication of Changes:** Users and stakeholders are not informed of updates.

## Conclusion
A bad service is the result of neglecting reliability, performance, security, maintainability, and user needs. Avoiding these pitfalls requires a commitment to best practices, continuous improvement, and a user-centric mindset.
