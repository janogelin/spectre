# Fail-Fast Principles: An Extensive List

Fail-fast is a design philosophy that encourages systems to detect and report errors as early as possible, preventing the propagation of faults and making issues easier to diagnose and fix. Below is a comprehensive list of fail-fast principles, each with a detailed explanation.

## 1. Immediate Error Detection
- **Validate Inputs Early:** Check all inputs at the boundaries of your system and reject invalid data immediately.
- **Assert Invariants:** Use assertions to ensure critical conditions are always true; fail if they are not.

## 2. Fast Failure on Dependency Issues
- **Check Dependencies at Startup:** Ensure all required services, databases, and resources are available before starting.
- **Fail on Missing Configuration:** Refuse to start if essential configuration is missing or invalid.

## 3. Explicit Error Reporting
- **Throw Exceptions on Errors:** Do not silently ignore or swallow errors; raise exceptions with clear messages.
- **Surface Failures to Callers:** Make sure errors are visible to upstream systems or users.

## 4. Avoiding Silent Failures
- **No Silent Catch Blocks:** Avoid empty catch blocks that hide problems.
- **Log All Failures:** Ensure every failure is logged with enough context for diagnosis.

## 5. Defensive Programming
- **Check All Return Values:** Always verify the results of function calls, especially those that can fail.
- **Guard Against Nulls:** Use null checks or option types to prevent null reference errors.

## 6. Early Resource Validation
- **Test Connections Upfront:** Open and validate connections to external systems at startup, not lazily.
- **Verify File and Network Access:** Ensure required files and network resources are accessible before proceeding.

## 7. Fail Fast, Recover Fast
- **Crash Early, Restart Quickly:** If a critical error occurs, fail immediately and rely on process supervisors or orchestrators to restart the service.
- **Avoid Prolonged Degraded States:** Do not continue running in a broken or partially functional state.

## 8. Clear and Actionable Error Messages
- **Provide Context in Errors:** Include relevant details (e.g., input values, state) in error messages.
- **Avoid Generic Errors:** Be specific about what failed and why.

## 9. Automated Health Checks
- **Self-Testing on Startup:** Run health checks and self-tests when the service starts.
- **Expose Health Endpoints:** Provide endpoints for external systems to verify service health.

## 10. Strict Contract Enforcement
- **Enforce API Contracts:** Validate that requests and responses conform to expected schemas.
- **Reject Unknown or Malformed Requests:** Do not attempt to process requests that do not match the contract.

## 11. No Partial Success
- **All-or-Nothing Operations:** Ensure operations either complete fully or not at all; avoid partial updates.
- **Rollback on Failure:** If part of a process fails, revert any changes made.

## 12. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Immediate Alerts on Failure:** Set up monitoring to alert operators as soon as a failure is detected.
- **Track Failure Rates:** Monitor error rates and trends to catch issues early.

## 13. Test for Failure Scenarios
- **Simulate Failures in Testing:** Regularly test how the system behaves under failure conditions.
- **Chaos Engineering:** Intentionally inject faults to ensure the system fails fast and recovers correctly.

## 14. Principle of Least Tolerance
- **Do Not Tolerate Known Bad States:** Refuse to operate if the system is in a known bad or inconsistent state.
- **Avoid Workarounds for Broken Dependencies:** Do not mask dependency failures with hacks or retries that hide the real problem.

## Conclusion
Fail-fast principles help build robust, maintainable, and observable systems by surfacing problems early and making them easier to fix. Adopting these practices leads to higher reliability and faster recovery from faults.
