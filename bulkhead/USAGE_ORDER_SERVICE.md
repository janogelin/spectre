# Using Bulkhead to Protect an Order Service

## Overview
The **Bulkhead** pattern is a resilience strategy that isolates critical resources in your system, preventing failures in one part from cascading to others. In a microservices architecture, this is especially important for services like an **Order Service** that depend on other services such as **Inventory** and **Payment**.

## Why Use Bulkhead?
When the Order Service calls both Inventory and Payment services, a failure or overload in one (e.g., Payment) can exhaust resources (like threads or connections), causing the entire Order Service to become unresponsiveâ€”even if Inventory is healthy. The Bulkhead pattern prevents this by allocating separate resource pools for each dependency.

## Conceptual Diagram

```
+-------------------+
|   Order Service   |
+-------------------+
        |   |
        |   |
  +-----+   +-----+
  |               |
  v               v
+---------+   +---------+
|Inventory|   | Payment |
| Bulkhead|   | Bulkhead|
+---------+   +---------+
```

- Each dependency (Inventory, Payment) has its own bulkhead (resource pool).
- If Payment is slow or failing, only its pool is affected; Inventory calls continue unaffected.

## Example Usage Steps

1. **Define Resource Pools**
   - Allocate separate thread pools, semaphores, or connection pools for Inventory and Payment calls.

2. **Integrate Bulkhead in Code**
   - When making a call to Inventory, use the Inventory bulkhead.
   - When making a call to Payment, use the Payment bulkhead.

   Example (pseudocode):
   ```python
   # Pseudocode for bulkhead usage
   inventory_bulkhead.submit(check_inventory, order)
   payment_bulkhead.submit(process_payment, order)
   ```

3. **Handle Bulkhead Rejection**
   - If a bulkhead is full (e.g., all threads are busy), fail fast or queue the request, and return a meaningful error to the user.

4. **Monitor and Tune**
   - Monitor the usage and adjust pool sizes based on traffic and dependency performance.

## Benefits
- Prevents a single failing dependency from bringing down the entire Order Service.
- Improves system stability and user experience.
